This is a short README file summarizing what the tools do and how to use them.

PartitionAnalysisCLI : Analyzes the partition layout of a cluster based on the
storage definitions for that cluster and determines how well balanced the
partition layout is.

Eg. use : 

voldemort.tools.PartitionAnalysisCLI --cluster <current-cluster> --stores <current-stores>

RepartitionerCLI : This tool can be used in two flavors (described below). The
inputs differ slightly on the use case.

Use case 1  : Shuffle the partitions around : The tool accepts an existing
cluster.xml, and generates a new final-cluster.xml. There are two choices on the
exact mechanism on how the repartition should be executed : random swapping or
greedy swapping. The tool also allows the flexibility on what zones can be
chosen for random shuffle.

Eg use :

voldemort.tools.RepartitionerCLI --current-cluster <current-cluster>
                                 --current-stores <current_stores>
                                 --output-dir <output_dir>
                                 --enable-random-swaps
                                 --random-swap-zoneids <zoneid>
                                 --random-swap-attempts <swap_attempts>


Use case 2 : Cluster expansion/Zone expansion : In this use case, apart from
the current cluster.xml the tool also needs as an input "interim-cluster.xml"
file. "Interim-cluster" contains the extra information about the nodes in the
"expanded" cluster or the new zone. The partition list associated with these
nodes, however is empty.

So for a zone expansion use case, the interim cluster would have information on
the new zone, nodes within that zone but will have an empty partition list.

When used in this scenario the tool generates a final-cluster.xml with a new
partition layout for the nodes. In short, it steals partitions from other zones
and moves it to the nodes in the new zone.

Eg. use :

voldemort.tools.RepartitionerCLI --current-cluster <current-cluster>
                                 --current-stores <current_stores>
	                             --interim-cluster <interim-cluster>
	                             --final-stores <final_stores>
                                 --output-dir <output_dir>
                                 

RebalancePlanCLI : This tool takes as input two cluster.xml's (the current and
the final) and generates a plan on how to get from the current cluster topology
to the final one.

RebalanceControllerCLI : This tool executes the actual rebalance operation
against a server. Internally it uses the planner to generate a plan and then
executes on that plan.
